Yambo 4.4.0 Release Notes
=========================

GENERAL
-------
- bin-libs -> lib/bin
- External libs clean-up improved
- debugging flags coded in acx_fortran_flags 
- SET_job_strings_and_dirs.F routine coded to handle new job string format. Example
  -J path1/path2/job,path3/jobp
- "js" removed from SET_defaults
- Closing operations moved into CLOSE_the_run routine
- GLOBAL renaming
 > OP_APP_CL -> OP_APP_WR_CL
 > stop_now -> STOP_now
 > string_remove -> STRING_remove
 > string_pack -> STRING_pack
 > SC_R -> H_rotation
- STRING_match routine added to compare avoiding the check on upper/lowercase.
- PARSER now re-organized with specific file names (PARSER_*.F)
 > Parsing of arrays better coded. Now they support memory.

YAMBO
-----
- XC_potentials added to handle the definition of kernel potentials (collisions)
- k-parallelization of:
  > COLLISIONS_compose (SC and RT)
  > G_lesser time-evolution
- QP_state_extract_print added to modularize the QP printing operation.
- OBS_rotate added and ready to be used.
  > H_rotate moved to separate routine
  > created a real_time_hamiltonian folder (includes RT-Hamiltonian related operations)
- Added FC-ORTHOROMBIC to crystal lattice.
- Added more PARALLEL logicals
 > logical           :: HEAD_q_cpu =.TRUE.
 > logical           :: HEAD_b_cpu =.TRUE.
- Now the input file is copied (adding the JOB identifier) when a com directory is different from the PWD. 
- INIT_report_and_log_files now defines log/report filenames
- New INTERPOLATION module
 > The old interpolation routines in ypp have been re-organized and modularized (now there is an INTERPOLATION_driver).
   The two methods (NearestNeighbout and Boltzmann) are coded.
- RT components now stored in an OBSERVABLE database.
 > JPC_RT_IO_t -> OBS_RT_IO_t
 > JPSM -> OBSERV
 > Complex io_bulk used in io_RT_components
- RT_ouput now made modular and splitted in several parts:
 > mod_RT_outuput
 > RT_FILE_add
- YPP interpolate routines made available to the main code moving interpolate in src

YPP
---
- ypp/init -> ypp/interface
- YPP "RTDBs" manual removed
- DEEP revision of all RT-related operations
 > Now INTERPOLATION using Boltzman works in all sections (RT-occs, RT-dos)
