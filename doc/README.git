Clone
=====
git clone ssh://developername@qeforge.qe-forge.org/gitroot/yambo-git ./

Branches list clean-up
=======================
git remote prune origin

Tags list update
================
git fetch --tags --all

status
==========
>git status #show status of local branch
>git status -uno #to show only modified files
>git remote show origin #show status of all branches

commit: The process of committing to the $YAMBO_REPO is a 3-steps process:
==========
stage the changes to be commited: “git add” (“git add --u” does not add new files)
commit to your local repo: “git commit”. In order to commit first run a
    > ./sbin/make_message.pl -p YOU
    and then to a 
    > git commit -F commit.msg
merge your local repo with the $YAMBO_REPO: “git push”

diff:
========
>git diff # shows changes not staged (before “add”)
>git diff HEAD # shows also changes staged but not commited (before “commit”)
>git diff origin/master # shown also changes committed (before “push”)
[ “-M50%” option is very useful in case of file renamed/moved ]

patch -p0 < patch:
==================
use “git diff > patch_name” to create a patch
use “git apply patch_name” to apply the patch

svn up: The process of updating to the last version in the $YAMBO_REPO is:
get the changes from the $YAMBO_REPO to your local repo: “git fetch”
get the changes to your working folder: “git merge origin/$branchname”
a+b.     It also exist the combined command: “git pull”

up --revision=XXXX  /  diff --revision=XXXX 
======================
with git you can ask to go back N revision: “git checkout HEAD~N”. git will enter detached HEAD mode. To move between commits “git checkout HEAD~M”, (use M=0)
for the HEAD itself. To come back to normal mode “git checkout $branchname” shows the changes compared to N revisions back: “git diff HEAD~N”

revert: To revert a change [everything before a push can reverted]
===========
To revert a change      → “git checkout -- .” (“git clean -df” also removes files not in repo)
to revert “git add”     → “git reset”
to revert “git commit”  → “git reset origin/master” (no history left)
                        → “git revert HEAD” (revert doing a commit)
To checkout a specific revision 
>git checkout 4a94fb6cd7037e910bae997f710fa71e3aa7d3f5 FILE
with 4a94fb6cd7037e910bae997f710fa71e3aa7d3f5 taken from log

To do a total checkout and reset
>git checkout -- .

LOG
====
>git log

merge:
=========
this is now “git merge”. No options are displayed during the merge. If you want the “tc” option for all the conflicts use: “git merge -X theirs”
After you can also use te “git mergetool” command. 

Checkout a branch:
===================
>git worktree add ~/Yambo/yambo/branches/BRANCH origin/BRANCH

Create a new branch:
===================
>git checkout -b new_branch
(equivalent to “git branch new_branch” + “git checkout new_branch”)
>git push origin new_branch  #if you want to make available the new branch
>git branch -u origin/new_branch new_branch #to set that the new branch tracks the new remote one

Create a new tag:
=================
From current branch you want to tag
>git tag -a 4.1.0 -m "Version 4.1.0" # new local tag created
>git push origin 4.1.0 # if you want to make available the new tag

Moving/removing files branches:
===============================
> git mv hello.html lib/
> git rm hello.html

Local & Remote
>git branch -d the_local_branch (local remove)
>git push origin :the_remote_branch (remote remove)

Only Remote
>git push origin --delete the_remote_branch

Sorting passws
===============
git config credential.helper store

Change remote origin
====================
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yambo/devel

Fork
====
Example for the creation of a new repo (superconductivity) + moving of a branch in the new repo:

Go here: https://github.com/organizations/yambo-code/repositories/new
and create a new repo (For example superconductivity.git)

>git remote add superconductivity git@github.com:yambo-code/superconductivity.git
>cd devel-sc-mu (the branch)

Push the local branch to the remote repo

>git push superconductivity devel-sc-mu

Set it as the default push/pull stream

>git push -u superconductivity devel-sc-mu

Remove the yambo-devel branch

>git push origin --delete devel-sc-mu
